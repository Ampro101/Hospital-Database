The form is built using HTML, CSS, and PHP.

FEATURES

The form has several sections including personal information, medical history, family medical history, allergies, and assigned doctors and nurses.
The form utilizes client-side validation using JavaScript to ensure that all required fields are filled in before submission.
The form is also server-side validated using PHP to prevent malicious attacks and to ensure that the data entered is in the correct format.
The form allows for multiple family members to be added and their medical history to be recorded.
The form uses a cool and modern CSS styling with a dark or light mode based on the system preference.
